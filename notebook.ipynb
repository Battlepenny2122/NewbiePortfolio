At the point of typing this Jupyter Notebook (31st of January, 2023), I have been dedicating my time learning Excel, SQL, Tableau, and some basic Python/R for about 1 month.\n\n### As you can see from most of the work, it is fairly rudimentary. However, coming from a non-cognate background, I am looking forward to learning more and more about data science, and how it applies to the real world. \n\n### I really appreciate your time looking through this notebook. It begins with a Pet Supplies Analysis, which involves cleaning data with Excel and basic visualisations with Tableau. Towards the end of this notebook, I have selected a few SQL interview questions I was able to complete unguided, and while not particularly difficult, demonstrate my skills in joining, aggregating, using subqueries with SQL.\n\n### If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me through the details on my resume. \n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"154e8a63-b9bd-46bd-adfa-974f0fe9c050"},{"source":"# Pet Supplies Analysis\n\nPlease see attached dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IgW-PKJZbjVxh7w3nT0UwsCS2jV2JzxXeVU4V3niXDE/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis basic analysis was part of my Data Analyst Associate certification where I was required to perform data validation with excel, and to use Tableau to visual some of my findings.\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a5b3bc0e-b993-4ee3-bd07-825a474bd0d9"},{"source":"## Data Validation","metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"The original dataset has 1500 rows and 8 columns.
